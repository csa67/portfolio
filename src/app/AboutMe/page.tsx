    <p>  I'm Sai Arathy Chava, and I have a passion for creating things that come to life on the web. My journey into Computer Science began with writing my first program in Logo—moving a turtle with commands like LT 90 and RT 90. That, combined with my love for math and problem-solving, has led me to where I am today.
        </p><p>
        With 2 years of experience at Deloitte Digital, an internship at one of India's top research labs, and my current role as a Graduate Student Assistant at UF, where I develop web interfaces to explore various agricultural scenarios, I enjoy crafting software that’s both visually appealing and efficient under the hood.

        When I’m away from the computer, you’ll likely find me enjoying movies, reading, spending time with friends and family, or cooking something special for them.
