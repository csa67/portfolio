    <h4> WHO AM I? </h4>
    <p> Hello! My name is Sai Arathy Chava and I love creating things that live on the internet. My interest in Computer Science started when I have written my first program in Logo. Drawing a turtle steps using LT 90, RT 90 and my love for math and problem solving turned me into a CS graduate student today.

        I have 2 years of experience working in Deloitte Digital, interned at a research lab in one of the topmost universities of India and now working as a Graduate Student Assistant at UF building web intefaces exploring different agriculture scenarios. I enjoy building software that looks good and is also built well under the hood.

        When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually watching movies, reading, hanging out with my friends and family, or cooking for them.
